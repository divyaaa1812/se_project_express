# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

The back-end of this project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Database - mongodb://localhost:27017

## Technologies Used

React JS, Express, MongoDB
